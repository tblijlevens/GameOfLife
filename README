Game of life representation following the rules of the Game of Life of John Conway. 
At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
 * 1: Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under population
 * 2: Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation
 * 3: Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation
 * 4: Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
